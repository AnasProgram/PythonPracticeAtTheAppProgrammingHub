# PythonPracticeAtTheAppProgrammingHub
In this program, I am rewriting all the Python programs that I have learned from the app “Programming Hub”. I am starting with the Array program. The goal of this project is to practice Java by rewriting the code myself and improving my understanding of programming concepts.
